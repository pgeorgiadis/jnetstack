# jnetstack

This is a TCP/IP stack I wrote as part of my thesis for my BSc in 2006-2007. Initially I was planing to integrate it to the JNode operating system, but unfortunately I never had the time to do so. I haven't worked on this code since then either.

Most of the TCP/IP stack is working fine. The TCP socket implementation was not 100% completed, but it was in a working state.
